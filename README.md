# AdventOfCode2022

These are my various tries to this amazing project: "Advent of Code", in the year 2022. What is advent of code?

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for anyone. 

I will try to do it with Python, since I don't know that language very well.
